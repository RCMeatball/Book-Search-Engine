# Book Search Engine

Using an already functioning Google Books API search engine, I reengineered it to work with GraphQL and Apollo Server. Allows Users to search books and save their searches so they can keep a list of books they want to read.

## Installation

```bash
npm i
```

## Run Application

npm run build
```
